                    <q>Though the pacing may be off at times--and some moments may feel like
                        Disney-rip-offs--Anastasia is a very well-done animated film,
                        and may arguably be the most stunning film of its genre to grace the silver screen.
                        It also contains one of the most beautiful songs ever written for
                        film: "Journey to the Past," and manages to brilliantly blur the line
                        between animation and real-life. With mostly strong dialogue, thrilling sequences,
                        and a powerful, moving story, Anastasia is a triumph.</q> <br>

                    <q>From Don Bluth comes the enchanting animated film Anastasia. When the Grand
                        Duchess offers a reward for her lost niece, Anastasia, a pair of charlatans
                        in St. Petersburg attempt to cash in by getting a naive young girl to play
                        the part, but they soon start to suspect that she could really be the lost
                        princess. The cast is exceptional, and includes John Cusack, Meg Ryan,
                        Christopher Lloyd, and Kelsey Grammer. The music is also excellent,
                        with a number of charismatic and lyrical songs. However, the film tries
                        to include some supernatural elements that don't quite work. A beautiful
                        and vibrant film, Anastasia is delightfully entertaining.</q> <br>

                    <q>I don't know exactly why it has taken me so long to view Anastasia.
                        When I was a kid, these were the types of movies I lived on and Anastasia
                        had I watched younger, would have most likely been one of those few
                        I watched over and over. Now as a twenty-year old I was still enraptured
                        in this film and its epic scope and dazzling music. It follows Disney's
                        formula, while besting them occasionally at it, and tells an important
                        and rather dark story built upon true events that are even darker.
                        Anastasia as a character is a brilliant depiction of a strong,
                        independent woman who is feminine but also fiery and harder-edged
                        than typical princessess' from Disney during this time. The music
                        is what ultimately sells this film. It is a full fledged musical with
                        Broadway style dance numbers and hard hitting ballads. Stephen Flaherty
                        composes some wonderful songs that lift the film when it starts to lag
                        and his work in Broadway musicals such as Ragtime is evident in the films
                        showstopping numbers. Minor flaws include a villain who seems disconnected
                        from the main storyline at times and a slight pacing lag near the end.
                        However, Anastasia is a film that gives Disney a run for its money.</q> <br>

            <h3>Anastasia Is Now a Disney Princess</h3>
            <h4>Princess Weekes</h4>
            <p>Dec 7th, 2020, 12:38 pm <br>
                Let’s journey into the past. <br>
                I saw Fox’s Anastasia in theaters as a child, and it was traumatic
                (that Rasputin scene) but also introduced me to the kink of liking
                boys who are kind of mean, via Dimitri. I had the VHS, which I abused,
                especially to listen to the end cover song of “Journey to the Past” by
                R’n’B artist Aaliyah. Anastasia also, therefore, was my entry point to
                the Russian Revolution and the Romanovs. <br>
                Which meant I learned, as Angela Lansbury explains in the opening,
                a jealous Rasputin infused with <q>demonic magic</q> turned the people
                of Russia against the royal family for casting him out. During
                the assault on the palace, Anastasia is saved by a young member of
                the proletariat class, kitchen boy Dimitri. She loses her memory and
                is raised in an orphanage as Anya, unaware that she is the Grand Duchess
                Anastasia, with a loving grand-mama in Paris voiced by Angela Lansbury.
                Thankfully, she has a McGuffin necklace and some vague memories that make
                her the perfect fit for adult Dimitri and his cohort Vlad to pass off as
                the real Anastasia. <br>
                So, imagine my shock when I picked up The Royal Diaries: Anastasia:
                The Last Grand Duchess, Russia, 1914 and found out that the Anastasia
                I knew and loved was based on a real person, and there was no magic
                involved, just politics and an economic revolution. Even that book did
                a lot of work to demonize Rasputin, since he was an unpopular figure,
                but not hated among the royals themselves. <br>
                Only later, after reading The Romanov Sisters: The Lost Lives of the
                Daughters of Nicholas and Alexandra, by Helen Rappaport, did I get a
                better understanding of the Romanovs and why this cult of personality
                emerged around Anastasia specifically. <br>
                Since their deaths, there have been several Romanov impostors because,
                due to the circumstances of their assassination and the chaotic organization
                surrounding it, communist misinformation, and a lack of DNA testing, there
                was a fairytale-like desire to see that one of the young Romanov kids had
                survived—the most famous of them being Anna Anderson. <br>
                Anderson (real name Franziska Schanzkowska) came on the scene in the 1920s,
                and while most members of the royal family didn’t think she was the real
                deal, some did. <br>
                Eventually, Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse, Anastasia’s maternal uncle,
                hired a private investigator to figure out the truth and identified her as
                Schanzkowska. Still, because Anderson has become so popular, the story lingered
                and was eventually the inspiration for the 1956 film Anastasia, starring
                Ingrid Bergman. That film would then turn into the plot premise for the
                ’90s animated classic that defined my childhood understanding of Anatasia. <br>
                Now the film has a home on Disney+, the same company that, when the film was
                originally released, decided to rerelease The Little Mermaid in theaters,
                just to mess with it. Well, talk about having your cake and eating it too. <br>
                Well, now when I rewatch Anastasia, I’m both amused by all the references
                to communism and actual historical detail, and also that a film could be
                so wildly inaccurate that it made the slaughter of an entire family into
                the premise for a <q>family</q> musical film. <br>
                That’s the power of cinema.
