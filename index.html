            </h2>
            <p>When the dark shadow of revolution falls on the house of the Romanovs,
                the royal family's youngest daughter, Anastasia, barely escapes the siege.
                Ten years later, knows herself only by the name Anya (Meg Ryan) due to amnesia
                caused by hitting her head that night. But Anya holds memories of a past
                which was full of palaces and parties. In order to discover more about this past,
                she travels to Paris with two con men, Dimitri (John Cusack,) and Vladimir
                (Kelsey Grammer), who plan on passing her off as Anastasia to collect the
                reward money offered by the Dowager Empress Marie Feodorovna (Dame Angela Lansbury)
                for the return of her granddaughter. But what they don't realize is that they
                have the real Anastasia? And what's worse, Grigori Rasputin (Christopher Lloyd),
                former confidant to the Czar, will not rest until he sees the last Romanov dead.</p>
