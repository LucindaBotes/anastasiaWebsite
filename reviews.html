                        <q>Though the pacing may be off at times--and some moments may feel like 
                        Disney-rip-offs--Anastasia is a very well-done animated film, 
                        and may arguably be the most stunning film of its genre to grace the silver screen. 
                        It also contains one of the most beautiful songs ever written for 
                        film: "Journey to the Past," and manages to brilliantly blur the line 
                        between animation and real-life. With mostly strong dialogue, thrilling sequences, 
                        and a powerful, moving story, Anastasia is a triumph.</q> <br>

                        <q>From Don Bluth comes the enchanting animated film Anastasia. When the Grand 
                        Duchess offers a reward for her lost niece, Anastasia, a pair of charlatans 
                        in St. Petersburg attempt to cash in by getting a naive young girl to play 
                        the part, but they soon start to suspect that she could really be the lost 
                        princess. The cast is exceptional, and includes John Cusack, Meg Ryan, 
                        Christopher Lloyd, and Kelsey Grammer. The music is also excellent, 
                        with a number of charismatic and lyrical songs. However, the film tries 
                        to include some supernatural elements that don't quite work. A beautiful 
                        and vibrant film, Anastasia is delightfully entertaining.</q> <br>

                        <q>I don't know exactly why it has taken me so long to view Anastasia. 
                        When I was a kid, these were the types of movies I lived on and Anastasia 
                        had I watched younger, would have most likely been one of those few 
                        I watched over and over. Now as a twenty-year old I was still enraptured 
                        in this film and its epic scope and dazzling music. It follows Disney's 
                        formula, while besting them occasionally at it, and tells an important 
                        and rather dark story built upon true events that are even darker. 
                        Anastasia as a character is a brilliant depiction of a strong, 
                        independent woman who is feminine but also fiery and harder-edged 
                        than typical princessess' from Disney during this time. The music 
                        is what ultimately sells this film. It is a full fledged musical with 
                        Broadway style dance numbers and hard hitting ballads. Stephen Flaherty 
                        composes some wonderful songs that lift the film when it starts to lag 
                        and his work in Broadway musicals such as Ragtime is evident in the films 
                        showstopping numbers. Minor flaws include a villain who seems disconnected 
                        from the main storyline at times and a slight pacing lag near the end. 
                        However, Anastasia is a film that gives Disney a run for its money.</q> <br>
